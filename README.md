# CSharpInterviewEssentials

A comprehensive guide to data structures and algorithms implemented in C#. This project serves as a reference for anyone looking to understand and apply fundamental concepts of computer science, especially in preparation for coding interviews.

## Project Structure

This project includes implementations and explanations for the following data structures and algorithms:

### Data Structures
- **Arrays** - Basic operations and usage examples.
- **Linked Lists** - Singly linked list with basic operations.
- **Stacks and Queues** - Stack and Queue implementations with examples.
- **Binary Trees** - Binary Search Tree with traversal examples.
- **Hash Tables** - Basic hash table implementation.

### Algorithms

#### Sorting
- **Basic Sorting** - Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort.
- **Advanced Sorting** - Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort.

#### Searching
- **Linear Search** - A simple, linear search algorithm.
- **Binary Search** - Efficient search algorithm for sorted arrays.

#### Graph Algorithms
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** - Level-order traversal of a graph.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** - Depth-order traversal of a graph.

### Planned Extensions
The following topics are planned for future updates:
- **Advanced Graph Algorithms** - Kruskal's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra's Algorithm.
- **Dynamic Programming** - Fibonacci (with memoization), Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence.

## Getting Started
